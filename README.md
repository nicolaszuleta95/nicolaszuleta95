I am a Data Analyst especially interested in analyzing and solving problems with insights from data and data science.

My motivation is to work on technological solutions that generate value in the world and impact it in a positive way.

My main strengths are data cleaning and data analysis with Python and SQL, data visualization with Power BI, and problem-solving.

I also love working with sports-related data.
